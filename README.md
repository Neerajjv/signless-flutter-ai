# Project SIGN-LESS: AI-Powered Communication for Non-Verbal Individuals

## Overview
**Project SIGN-LESS** is an AI-driven assistive communication tool designed to break barriers for non-verbal individuals. Unlike traditional solutions that rely on sign language or manual text input, SIGN-LESS enables seamless verbal interactions through real-time speech recognition, sentiment-aware response generation, and instant speech output.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Speech Recognition** – Captures external conversations and transcribes them.
- **Context & Sentiment Analysis** – Understands the tone and intent of conversations.
- **AI-Powered Response Suggestions** – Generates multiple response choices for user selection.
- **User-Controlled Speech Output** – Ensures accurate and personalized communication.
- **Fast & Accessible** – Works without requiring sign language proficiency.

## System Architecture
| Component               | Functionality                                           |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Speech Recognition** | Captures and transcribes external speech in real time. |
| **Sentiment Analysis**  | Determines response tone based on conversation.        |
| **Response Generation**| Provides multiple response options.                     |
| **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** | Converts the selected response into spoken output.   |
| **User Interface**      | Displays responses and facilitates user selection.      |

## Workflow
1. The system listens to external speech.
2. Transcribes spoken words into text.
3. Analyzes sentiment and intent.
4. AI generates four response options.
5. User selects a response, which is then spoken aloud.
6. System resets and continues listening for further conversations.

## Installation & Setup
